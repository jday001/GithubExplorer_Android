###GithubExplorer for Android

This is a version of the GithubExplorer project written natively for Android in Kotlin.

####Pros
- Kotlin (type safety, concise, great readability -- very similar to Swift)
- Visual tools for UI layout, XML structure
- Great debugging & performance profiling tools
- Great community support & StackOverflow

####Cons
- Android Studio could be better, but still pretty good overall
- UI work and navigation is slightly more nuanced and complicated than iOS
- Some common patterns and 3rd party libraries to wrap your head around, but helpful once you understand them
- Supporting older versions can be a little confusing

####Development
|   |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| __Time to build__ | ~ 2 days, with about 3 days of tutorials & learning first |
| __Experience Level__ | Almost no proir Android experience, zero Kotlin experience. 2-3 days of tutorials. Kotlin is very similar to Swift and easy to pick up. |
| __External Dependencies__ | [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson), [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/)* |
| __Learning Curve __ | Higher than iOS but feeling pretty confident after a week or so.  |

*These are almost universally used in Android apps and make networking, JSON, and image loading almost seamless.
